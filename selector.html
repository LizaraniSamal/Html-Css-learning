      Jawaharlal Nehru was an Indian anti-colonial nationalist, secular
      humanist, social democrat,[2] and author<br />
      who was a central figure in India during the middle of the 20th century.
      Nehru was a principal leader of the<br />
      Indian nationalist movement in the 1930s and 1940s. Upon India's
      independence in 1947, he served as the <br />
      country's first prime minister for 16 years.[3] Nehru promoted
      parliamentary democracy, secularism, and science<br />
      and technology during the 1950s, powerfully influencing India's arc as a
      modern nation.

    <h2> earth</h2>
    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor<br>
       life. This is enabled by Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar System<br>
       sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its <br>
       global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's surface. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's <br>
       surface is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within<br>
       one hemisphere, Earth's land hemisphere.</p>
