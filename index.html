    <h1>Narendra Damodardas Modi </h1>
             Modi born in 17 September 1950)[b] is an <a href="#nowhere">Indian</a> politician who has served as the 14th prime minister of India since May 2014.<hr>
             Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament (MP) for Varanasi.<hr>
             He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS),<hr>
             a right-wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest-serving prime <hr>
             minister from outside the Indian National Congress.

<br>
            According to Modi, as a child, he had to work in his father's tea shop on the platform of Vadnagar railway<br>
            station,[44] but the evidence of his neighbours does not entirely corroborate this statement.[45][46] During<br>
            a protest against the government, his brother, Prahlad Modi, contradicted that he ever sold tea. <br>
            According to him, his father had brought up six of his children by selling tea and people were making a big<br>
            mistake by calling the Prime Minister a "chai wala".
